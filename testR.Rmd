```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

can i commit and push?

## R Markdown

Some changes.

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Changes to pdf

What I'd really like to do is change the pdf, not push it, and see what happens...

```{r}
plot(cars)
```
